# DND-Tool <Rename Me :(>

[![Hex.pm](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/l/plug.svg)](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) 

Purpose
-------
<Tool Name> is designed to help remove some of the tediousness that encumbers all members of the adventure as well as help facilitate distribution of information to each adventurer from the Dungeon Master.

Why?
----
As a Dungeon Master, there have been a couple things I've found slightly tedious. While I enjoy watching the adventurers sweat as they perform a saving throw roll to reduce or negate an effect, rolling for combat encounter initiative isn't quite as fun.

Features
--------
  - Account registration
  - Player character creation
  - Initiative tracker
  - Combat tracker
  - Ability tracker


Features Explained
------------------
Players will be able to register an account on a server using the [SRP Protocol][SRP Site].

Once logged in, players can choose one of the characters they've previously created, or create a new character to use for their adventure.

When the Dungeon Master begins an encounter, they may automatically roll initiative for each player. The initiative roll will automatically apply any modifiers to the die result. The Dungeon Master will be able to manually modify any initiative result they desire.

<Combat Tracker Section TBD>

Ability cooldowns, such as Encounter and Daily abilities, can be tracked by all players. It is up to the Dungeon Master to reset these abilities, and can do so for some or all of the players.
